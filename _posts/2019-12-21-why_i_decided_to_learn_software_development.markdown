In high school, I decided to conduct my Senior Project on Audio Engineering. My goal was to demonstrate how advancements in technology have made it significantly easier for one, even with limited knowledge and experience, to enter the world of artistry. I chose this project as I felt that creativity is something that should be embraced, not neglected. As teenagers, we are taught to let go of our creative ideas as they are not valuable assets in the “real world.” The most straightforward part of my project was finding information on how technological advancements have affected the music industry. The hardest part, however, was learning the many techniques used to engineer a song and how to build a website and develop my own online e-commerce store offering services to an artist looking to begin their musical journey. This process of creating my online store is where my interest in coding began. I used a site known as WordPress to fully construct my own fully-functional store where an artist could go and purchase both instrumentals and mixing/mastering services without having to spend large amounts of money for professional studio time. Since this, I have been heavily considering Software Engineering as a career path and feel as if going through Flatiron’s Software Development course is the first step on the road to accomplishing just that. Technology today is a cornerstone in every aspect of life, and I am fascinated that I also can play a part in developing new and improved solutions for the problems in today’s rapidly evolving world.
